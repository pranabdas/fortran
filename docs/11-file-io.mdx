import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

Here we will generate some data and write it to a file:

import file_write from '!!raw-loader!/src/08_file_write.f90';

<CodeBlock language="fortran" title="src/08_file_write.f90" showLineNumbers>{file_write}</CodeBlock>

:::info

Note that `unit=0`, `5`, and `6` are reserved. Do not use them to identify files
in your programs. Some older compilers might other other low unit numbers for
internal usage. It is safer and conventional to use unit number 10 and above for
user files.

:::

Reading from file: we will read the data from file that is generated in the
above example.

import file_read from '!!raw-loader!/src/09_file_read.f90';

<CodeBlock language="fortran" title="src/09_file_read.f90" showLineNumbers>{file_read}</CodeBlock>


## FORTRAN Namelist

FORTRAN Namelist provides an easy way to read and write groups of variables.
Namelists simplify reading and writing variables to files without needing to
specify variable formats for each I/O operation. The namelist group is defined
in the Fortran code, and the corresponding input/output text uses a specific
format:
- Begins with `&groupname`
- Lists variable assignments (comma or space separated)
- Ends with `/`.

### Namelist example
Namelists are used in [Quantum ESPRESSO input files](
https://pranabdas.github.io/espresso/hands-on/scf).

Here is an example namelist:

import qe_in from '!!raw-loader!/src/30_qe.in';

<CodeBlock language="fortran" title="src/30_qe.in" showLineNumbers>{qe_in}</CodeBlock>

We can read and parse various inputs following way:

import read_namelist from '!!raw-loader!/src/30_namelist.f90';

<CodeBlock language="fortran" title="src/30_namelist.f90" showLineNumbers>{read_namelist}</CodeBlock>
