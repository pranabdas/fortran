import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

Here we will generate some data and write it to a file:

import file_write from '!!raw-loader!/src/08_file_write.f90';

<CodeBlock language="fortran" title="src/08_file_write.f90" showLineNumbers>{file_write}</CodeBlock>

:::info

Note that `unit=0, 5, and 6` are reserved. Do not use them to identify files in
your programs.

:::

Reading from file: we will read the data from file that is generated in the
above example.

import file_read from '!!raw-loader!/src/09_file_read.f90';

<CodeBlock language="fortran" title="src/09_file_read.f90" showLineNumbers>{file_read}</CodeBlock>
